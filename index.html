        If music can restore your mind, how can an accessible and music therapy approach to music combined with artistic mediums further and greatly impact individuals?
    </strong></p>  

    <p class="subtext">
    It would be wonderful for Deaf and Hard of Hearing individuals to experience music with visuals and actual representations to connect with the message of the music and understand the instruments which are being played.
    The healing powers of music has helped individuals recover from trauma and relax before surgery. A tactile object corresponding to the music visualization could assist individuals who enjoy feeling the beat or vibration of the music, especially with instrumental music.

    <h2>The initial idea</h2>
    <p>
        Sensability is a project I started in Experimental Interaction which is designed for Deaf audiences to visualize and feel music. The idea for my project was to explore with different music sources with the movement of the amplitude which incorporates a dimensional visualization. In Cinema 4D, different sections of the visualization is synced to selected areas of the music's amplitude to establish a realized visual experience.    

        The music visualization correlates with a 3D printed object through an augmented reality experience with the printed object activating the visualization.

        “What are the lyrics saying? Some music doesn't have lyrics. What is the instrument being played? Maybe there is a video of a person playing the instrument. This would help identify the instrument that is being played and would make an impact." -Amanda Tuite

            After sharing my initial Augmented Reality music visualization which represented actual sound reaction movement with sphere objects to Amanda and Parker, their feedback inspired the idea of a instrumental music visualization with actual instrument representation. The additional suggestion of possibly “pursuing the therapy aspect of this tool” for the tactile aspect further motivated my idea to expand the audience to music therapy and include haptics with the tactile aspect.

        <h2>The Prototype</h2>

    <section class="post">


    <p>
        The prototype of this project started with an initial music visualization focused on connecting the visuals to the instruments in the song. After the initial prototype visualization was created, some feedback I received was:
        "What is the emotion?", "With the instruments, how is it supposed to inspire me?"
        The song used in this prototype is “A Peaceful Winter” by Scott Holmes from Free Music Archive. By incorporating winter scene colors and visuals in addition to the instruments, it would help viewers understand the emotion of the music, especially for some viewers watching this without sound. Additional feedback includes:  “If someone does not have an idea of what the instrument is or what the notes sound like or has never heard the instrument before; and if you are going to incorporate the instruments, think about how you are going to indicate the highest and lowest string in the violin representing high or low notes.“

            The initial prototype design included music instruments that were designed in Cinema 4D and Adobe Illustrator. Included in the original design were captions to assist the visuals in the motion design. One of my Subject Matter Experts, Amanda Tuite suggested including captions in the design but making it an option instead of directly integrating them in the video as some individuals might want to see the visuals without captions.

        <h2>Sensability App</h2>
    <section class="post">
        <p>
            With designing for music therapy audiences, This app idea was inspired by a google chrome accessibility profile extension idea, I started in the Experimental Interaction course at the beginning of this project as a way to accommodate music experiences.
            It develped into a personalized music visualization where users can select the music visualizations based on the music style, tempo, and if desired accessibility settings. There is a subscription aspect to this app design where users have the option to recieve a tactile aspect, have access to music therapy resources and connect with music therapists.

    <h3>Initial thoughts for app design</h3>

    <h3>Original app idea</h3>

        </div>
    </div>

    <section class="post">
        <p>
            The main idea for the original design was to have a selection of music visualizations display based on the users feelings/mood. This would be similar to meditation or relaxing apps in the market such as the Calm app except the emotion aspect would be decided by the user. Initially, there was going to be three main styles of visualizations in the app design: dimensional, abstract, and simple. 
Based on user experience feedback, too much visuals can possibly cause motion sickness for individuals with sensorineural hearing loss if there is too much. This feedback inspired the simple visualization style.

    <h3>Revised app design</h3>

        </div>

        <section class="post">
            <p>
                As the mood/ feeling music visualization idea became more complicated a of a process, the process was simplified to start with the desired music genre style, tempo, and accessibility settings. 

The goal of this updated idea is the music activates a memory response. By communicating the emotion and message of a particular song, the imagery brings the viewer to remember an emotion/memory associated to the music. This serves the goal of visualizing/communicating music for the Deaf/Hard of Hearing audiences and the therapy aspect of emotion/cognition restoration/music rehabilitation.

        <h2>Medo</h2>
    <section class="post">
        <p>
            Medo (meadow), is the tactile aspect counterpart of the Sensability app. With Medo, users can feel sound with along with the app visualizations with the integration of haptic hardware inside the design. The song in the music visualization correlates with portraying textures on the tactile aspect representing the notes played. The purpose of the tactile aspect is to have an actual feeling of the sound of music while viewing the music visualizations for music therapy, Deaf or Hard of hearing individuals.

            The seashell texture on the first idea is inspired by a sensory stimulation guide for individuals with neurocogniitive disorders. The texture on the second idea is inspired by textures which can improve the brain through touch.

    <h3>Development of Medo design</h3>

    </div>

    <section class="post">


        <p>
            The seashell texture in the original idea was continued into this updated design as the base of the structure would be in the same shell shape.
            I showed my original designs to Parker, a subject matter expert for my project, and asked, How can I make the design have more intention with the texture? Parker suggested “map unique shapes to the sound I am looking to capture so there is a cohesion between the song, object and vibration movement. For the demo of Medo, it will correspond with the instrumental piano song called “Bird Language” by Chad Crouch on Free Music Archive. The corresponding visualization is an example which will be displayed in the final app design. 
        This suggestion led to an initial guide to visualize the piano keys which are played along with the number of times each key was played. If it was a high note, it would be show by a circle, a low note would show a pill shape. 

        Developing the tactile aspect first in Adobe Illustrator, I used the initial music guide for the tactile object and used shapes to represent the piano notation. Once this was complete, I designed the tactile aspect in Cinema 4D.

            I created an example of a paper protype of the tactile aspect which will be 3D printed. Using the paper prototype as a guide, some of the shapes were modeled to achieve an idea of how the actual 3D model will look. After the paper prototype, I continued to develop the shapes on the end of the right and left side

            The Medo design was created in Cinema 4D, a 3D modeling software. The shell design was developed using a spline path, an outlined path which can be extruded into 3D,  while sculptural dimension was added to the different objects. 
        </p>

    <div class="post">
        <p>
            Once the Medo design was complete in Cinema 4D, a stereolithography (stl) file was exported into the Sindoh 3DWOX 1 3D printer app to be produced. Using a white polylatic acid (PLA) filament for the Medo design, the final design was complete after eight hours of printing production.
