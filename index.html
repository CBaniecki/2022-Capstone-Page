        How can an accessible, media rich approach to music offer individuals a greater therapeutic impact?

    </strong></p>  

    <p class="subtext">
        Even though captions are available, they are not as descriptive and sometimes are either delayed or not provided at all. Captions do not describe the instruments being played or the message of the song, which is not helpful to Deaf or Hard of Hearing users to understand the music. It would be wonderful for Deaf and Hard of Hearing individuals to experience music with visuals and actual representations to connect with the message of the music and understand the instruments which are being played. 
    
        Creating a music visualization focused on representing the instruments would provide both Deaf and Hard of Hearing individuals with a realized visual experience while maintaining a therapeutic approach.

    <h2>The initial idea</h2>
    <p>
        Sensability is a project I started in Experimental Interaction which is designed for Deaf audiences to visualize and feel music. The idea for my project was to explore with different music sources with the movement of the amplitude which incorporates a dimensional visualization. In Cinema 4D, different sections of the sphere objects is synced to selected areas of the music's amplitude and reacts by upward and downward movement.    

        The music visualization correlates with a 3D printed object through an augmented reality experience with the printed object activating the visualization.

        “I think some of the frustration I've had with listening to music after losing my hearing was that captioning never really seems to capture the heart of the piece — the movement of the audio clip.”

    <p>
        “What are the lyrics saying? Some music doesn't have lyrics. What is the instrument being played? Maybe there is a video of a person playing the instrument. This would help identify the instrument that is being played and would make an impact." -Amanda Tuite

        Parker Fox, is the online learning instructional designer for Minneapolis College of Art and Design. Parker is Hard of Hearing which connects with my audience for Deaf/Hard of Hearing individuals. As an artist, Parker has worked with integrating sound in their projects. Parker has research experience with creating accessible viewing experiences for individuals. The combination of feedback from Parker's experience and design expertise is truly valuable.

        Amanda Tuite is an educator, Deaf community advocate, and mentor as well as CEO and Co-Founder of Access Vine, an inclusion training service. Her experience as a Deaf individual and advocate is a truly valuable asset to my Capstone project. I connected with her along with an American Sign Language (ASL) interpreter through two
        zoom meetings.
    </p>

    <p>
        After sharing my initial Augmented Reality music visualization to Amanda and Parker, their feedback inspired the idea of a instrumental music visualization with actual instrument representation.    The additional suggestion of possibly “pursuing the therapy aspect of this tool” for the tactile aspect further motivated my idea to expand the audience to music therapy and include haptics with the tactile aspect.
   </p>

   <p>
    Gabby Gifford's story on recovering from a Traumatic Brain injury by using music is inspiring this Capstone project. She regained her ability to speak by “learning to repeat ordinary phrases in a sing-songy voice. A song would gradually become a chant and finally a spoken phrase with the natural rhythm of speech” ("How music therapy is helping Rep. Giffords and others recover their ability to speak").  Designing for Deaf, Hard of Hearing, and Music Therapy audiences share this elevated healing connection as the music therapy resources could be beneficial for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community as well.

        <h2>The Prototype</h2>

    <section class="post">


    <p>
        The prototype of this project started with an initial music visualization focused on connecting the visuals to the instruments in the song. After the initial prototype visualization was created, some feedback I received was:
        "What is the emotion?", "With the instruments, how is it supposed to inspire me?"
    </p>
    </section>

    <section class="post">
        <p>
            Incorporating winter scene colors and visuals in the music visualization to connect with the song used in this prototype “A Peaceful Winter” by Scott Holmes from Free Music Archive; would help viewers understand the emotion of the music, especially for some viewers watching this without sound.
            
            Additional feedback includes:  “If someone does not have an idea of what the instrument is or what the notes sound like or has never heard the instrument before; and if you are going to incorporate the instruments, think about how you are going to indicate the highest and lowest string in the violin representing high or low notes.“

            The initial prototype design included music instruments that were designed in Cinema 4D and Adobe Illustrator. Included in the original design were captions to assist the visuals in the motion design. One of my Subject Matter Experts, Amanda Tuite suggested including captions in the design but making it an option instead of directly integrating them in the video as some individuals might want to see the visuals without captions.

            The instrument visuals continued into this revised prototype with the addition of simulating the live movement representation of the instruments. Winter elements were added to the composition to communicate the feeling and emotion of the music with the instruments.

        <h2>Sensability App</h2>
    <section class="post">
        <p>
            With designing for music therapy audiences, This app idea was inspired by a google chrome accessibility profile extension idea, I started in the Experimental Interaction course at the beginning of this project as a way to accommodate music experiences.
            It develped into a personalized music visualization where users can select the music visualizations based on the music style, tempo, and if desired accessibility settings. There is a subscription aspect to this app design where users have the option to recieve a tactile aspect, have access to music therapy resources and connect with music therapists.
        </p>
    </section>

    <h3>Initial thoughts for app design</h3>

        </div>
    </div>

    <section class="post">
        <p>
            The main idea for this project was complete, a motion design music visualization. These ideas are my thoughts on the ways I can progress this main idea into more of a successful project with a focus on goals to benefit the user. My idea/ thought for the extension of this music visualization was going to be therapy resources for anyone who has endured something similar such as another surgery, diagnosis, or health complication themselves, or experienced it with a loved one. Sometimes when individuals are going through obstacles, there is limited resources, or ways to communicate personal feelings/emotions. 
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="post">
        <p>
            Maybe this extension includes: resources, a written journal aspect, shared stories or images, a comedy or relaxation page for an assisting purpose? With the initial idea of this project including a 3D printed tactile aspect, I wanted to find a way to successfully connect the tactile aspect with the music visualization. Maybe rethinking the idea of a subscription aspect is where the tactile aspect could be included. 
            One of my original ideas was a google chrome accessibility extension. Could this extension possibly be included?
        </p>

    <h3>Original app idea</h3>

            <img src="images/initialappidea.jpg">
        </div>
    </div>

    <section class="post">
        <p>
            The main idea for the original design was to have a selection of music visualizations display based on the users feelings/mood. This would be similar to meditation or relaxing apps in the market such as the Calm app except the emotion aspect would be decided by the user. Initially, there was going to be three main styles of visualizations in the app design: dimensional, abstract, and simple. 
Based on user experience feedback, too much visuals can possibly cause motion sickness for individuals with sensorineural hearing loss if there is too much. This feedback inspired the simple visualization style. 
        </p>

    <h3>Revised app design</h3>


        <div class="image gallery">

        </div>

        <section class="post">
            <p>
                As the mood/ feeling music visualization idea became more complicated a of a process, the process was simplified to start with the desired music genre style, tempo, and accessibility settings. 

                The goal of this updated idea is the music activates a memory response. By communicating the emotion and message of a particular song, the imagery brings the viewer to remember an emotion/memory associated to the music. This serves the goal of visualizing/communicating music for the Deaf/Hard of Hearing audiences and the therapy aspect of emotion/cognition restoration/music rehabilitation. 

                The updated visualization styles would consist of actual video of the instruments being played in addition to 2D and 3D graphic design renderings.

        <h2>Medo</h2>
    <section class="post">
        <p>
            Medo (meadow), is the tactile aspect counterpart of the Sensability app. The goal of the Medo device is users will be able to feel the vibrations of the sound along with the corresponding music visualizations with haptics integrated in the design. The song in the music visualization correlates with portraying textures on the tactile aspect representing the notes played.The web development code to function this Medo device is currently in the testing phase. However, the hardware which will function the Medo device will be included in the design. The hardware consists of a Groove by Arduino base shield, rotary angle sensor, sound sensor, red LED sensor and vibration motor.

            Since one of the focuses of this project is a music therapy aspect, the textures on these designs could be similar to occupational therapy objects to relieve stress. The seashell texture on the first idea is inspired by a sensory stimulation guide for individuals with neurocogniitive disorders. The texture on the second idea is inspired by textures which can improve the brain through touch.

    <section class="post">


        <p>
            The seashell texture in the original idea was continued into this updated design as the base of the structure would be in the same shell shape.
            I showed my original designs to Parker, a subject matter expert for my project, and asked, How can I make the design have more intention with the texture? Parker suggested “map unique shapes to the sound I am looking to capture so there is a cohesion between the song, object and vibration movement. 
        </p>

            For the demo of Medo, it will correspond with the instrumental piano song called “Bird Language” by Chad Crouch on Free Music Archive. The corresponding visualization is an example which will be displayed in the final app design. 
        This suggestion led to an initial guide to visualize the piano keys which are played along with the number of times each key was played. If it was a high note, it would be show by a circle, a low note would show a pill shape. 

        Developing the tactile aspect first in Adobe Illustrator, I used the initial music guide for the tactile object and used shapes to represent the piano notation. Once this was complete, I designed the tactile aspect in Cinema 4D.

            I created an example of a paper protype of the tactile aspect which will be 3D printed. Using the paper prototype as a guide, some of the shapes were modeled to achieve an idea of how the actual 3D model will look. After the paper prototype, I continued to develop the shapes on the end of the right and left side.

            The Medo design was created in Cinema 4D, a 3D modeling software. The shell design was developed using a spline path, an outlined path which can be extruded into 3D,  while sculptural dimension was added with three-dimensional objects. 
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="post">
        <p>
            Once the Medo design was complete in Cinema 4D, a stereolithography (stl) file was exported into the Sindoh 3DWOX 1 3D printer app to be produced. The Medo device consists of a top and bottom structure. The bottom section holds the hrdardware and the top section incorporates the tactile representation which connects to the music visualization.  
            Using a white polylatic acid (PLA) filament for the Medo design the 3D printer composes the design by extruding filament from the nozzle of the printer and a grid structure builds the 3D printed model. The final design was complete after eight hours of printing production for both the top and bottom structures.
