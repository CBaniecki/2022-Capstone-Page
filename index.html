        If music can restore your mind, how can an accessible and music therapy approach to music combined with artistic mediums further and greatly impact individuals?

    It is proven music therapy can restore you mind after trauma. The healing powers of music maintain a dual purpose to heal individuals by restoring the intellect and concurrently giving individuals access to sound.

    Music helps you feel joy especially if you are experiencing difficult situations while having the ability to repair brain damage and return lost memories.
