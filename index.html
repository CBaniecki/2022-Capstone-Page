    <p>
    It would be wonderful for deaf and hard of hearing individuals to experience music with visuals and actual representations to connect with the message of the music and understand the instruments which are being played.
    The healing powers of music has (helped/aided) individuals recover from trauma and relax before surgery. A tactile object corresponding to the music visualization could assist individuals who enjoy feeling the beat or vibration of the music, especially with instrumental music.

        “I think some of the frustration I've had with listening to music after losing my hearing was that captioning never really seems to capture the heart of the piece — the movement of the audio clip.”

        “What are the lyrics saying? Some music doesn't have lyrics. What is the instrument being played? Maybe there is a video of a person playing the instrument. This would help identify the instrument that is being played and would make an impact. -Amanda Tuite
