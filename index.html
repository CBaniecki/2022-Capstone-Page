        How can an accessible, media rich approach to music offer individuals a greater therapeutic impact?

    </strong></p>  

    <p class="subtext">
        It would be wonderful for Deaf and Hard of Hearing individuals to experience music with visuals and actual representations to connect with the message of the music and understand the instruments which are being played. 
    
        Some of the responses I received from Deaf individuals was there was no interest or engagement in music. However,  there was an appreciation for creating visual music for deaf individuals. 
    </p>

    <p class="subtext">
        This feeback inspired my design challenge to transform this problem into a creative approach.
        
        Creating a music visualization focused on representing the instruments would provide both Deaf and Hard of Hearing individuals with a realized visual experience while maintaining a therapeutic approach. 

        When listening to music, it engages both hemispheres of the brain and multiple areas of the brain bilaterally. For Traumatic Brain Injury patients, music is important as this healing benefit with music helps restore the brain and stimulates neuroplasticity.

    <h2>The initial idea</h2>
    <p>
        Sensability is a project initially designed for Deaf audiences to visualize and feel music. I started this project in Experimental Interaction, a course as a part of the Master of Arts in Graphic and Web Design curriculum. The idea for my project was to explore with different music sources with the movement of the amplitude which incorporates a dimensional visualization. 
        
     </p>

     <p>
        In Cinema 4D, a three-dimensional modeling software, different sections of the sphere objects is synced to selected areas of the music's amplitude and reacts by upward and downward movement.    
     </p>

     <p>
        The music visualization correlates with a 3D printed object through an interactive real-world environment or augmented reality experience with the printed object activating the visualization. 

        The shape of the 3D printed tactile aspect in this design was established from a p5.js code file which is a Javascript library for creative coding.

    <p>
        “What are the lyrics saying? Some music doesn't have lyrics. What is the instrument being played? Maybe there is a video of a person playing the instrument. This would help identify the instrument that is being played and would make an impact." - Amanda Tuite

        zoom meetings.
    </p>

    <p>
        After sharing my initial music visualization to Amanda and Parker, their feedback inspired the idea of a instrumental music visualization with actual instrument representation.    The additional suggestion from Parker of possibly “pursuing the therapy aspect of this tool” for the tactile aspect further motivated my idea to expand the audience to music therapy and include haptics with the tactile aspect.

   <p>
    Designing for Deaf, Hard of Hearing, and Music Therapy audiences share this elevated healing connection as music therapy resources could be beneficial for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community as well.

        <h2>The Prototype</h2>

    <section class="post">
    <section class="post-content">

        <p>
            The prototype of this project started with an initial music visualization focused on connecting the visuals to the instruments in the song. The goal is to establish a visual music experience with instrument representation for Deaf and Hard of Hearing individuals. 
    
            The song used in this prototype is “A Peaceful Winter” by Scott Holmes from Free Music Archive, which is an online library of royalty-free music. Selecting this song was inspired from responses from Subject Matter Experts, a desire for more visual representation of instruments in songs.  
        </p>

        <p>
            The prototype design included music instruments that were designed in Cinema 4D, a three-dimensional modeling software, and Adobe Illustrator, a vector graphic digital editing and design software. After the designs were complete, the instrument graphics were integrated into After Effects, a digital motion graphics compositing application, for the production of the motion design.

            Included in the original design were captions to assist the visuals in the motion design. One of my Subject Matter Experts, Amanda Tuite suggested including captions in the design but making it an option instead of directly integrating them in the video as some individuals might want to see the visuals without captions. 
        </p>

        <p>
        
            After the initial prototype visualization was created, additional feedback I received from Amanda was:
            "What is the emotion?", "With the instruments, how is it supposed to inspire me?"
       
            I could incorporate winter scene colors and visuals in the music visualization to establish a connection with the song used in this prototype “A Peaceful Winter” by Scott Holmes from Free Music Archive, an online library of royalty-free music. It would help viewers understand the emotion of the music, especially for some viewers watching this without sound.
            
        </p>

        <p>
            Additional feedback includes:  “If someone does not have an idea of what the instrument is or what the notes sound like or has never heard the instrument before; and if you are going to incorporate the instruments, think about how you are going to indicate the highest and lowest string in the violin representing high or low notes.“

            The instrument visuals continued into this revised prototype with the addition of simulating the live movement representation of the instruments. Winter elements were added to the composition to communicate the feeling and emotion of the music with the instruments. 
            In addition, movement with a camera was specified with keyframes, a position in time within the composition to define the animation transitions.

        <h2>Sensability App</h2>
    <section class="post">
        <p>
            With designing for music therapy audiences, This app was inspired by a google chrome accessibility profile extension idea, I started at the beginning of this project as a way to accommodate music experiences.
            It develped into a personalized music visualization where users can select the music visualizations based on the music style, tempo, and if desired accessibility settings. By subscribing to the app, users have the option to recieve a Medo device, have access to music therapy resources and connect with music therapists.
        </p>
    </section>

    <h3>Initial thoughts for app design</h3>


    <section class="post">
    <section class="post-content">
        <p>
            The main idea for this project was complete, a motion design music visualization. Sometimes when individuals are going through obstacles, there is limited resources, or ways to communicate personal feelings or emotions. The original concept for the extension of this music visualization was going to be therapeutic resources for anyone who has endured a surgery, diagnosis, or health complication themselves, or experienced it with a loved one.  
        </p>
 
        <p>
            Maybe this extension includes: resources, a written journal aspect, shared stories or images, a comedy or relaxation page for an assisting purpose? With the initial idea of this Sensability project including a 3D printed tactile aspect, I wanted to find a way to successfully connect the tactile aspect with the music visualization. Is rethinking the idea of a subscription aspect is possibly where the tactile aspect could be included? 
            These ideas are my thoughts on the ways I can progress this main idea into a successful project with a focus on goals to benefit the user.

    <h3>Original app idea</h3>

    <section class="post">
        <p>
            The main idea for the original app design was to have a selection of music visualizations display based on the users feelings or mood. This would be similar to meditation or relaxing apps in the market such as the Calm app, an app designed for sleep and meditation. The emotion aspect for this idea would be decided by the user. Initially, there was going to be three main styles of visualizations in the app design: dimensional, abstract, and simple. 
            Based on user experience feedback, too much visuals can possibly cause motion sickness for individuals with sensorineural hearing loss. This feedback inspired the simple visualization style.

        </div>

        <section class="post">
            <p>
                As the idea for the display of music visualization centered around mood or feelings became more complicated a of a process, the process was simplified to start with the desired music genre style, tempo, and accessibility settings. 

                The goal of this updated idea is the music activates a memory response. By communicating the emotion and message of a particular song, the imagery brings the viewer to remember an emotion or memory associated to the music. This serves the goal of visualizing and communicating music for the Deaf, Hard of Hearing audiences and the therapy aspect of music rehabilitation. 

                The updated visualization styles would consist of actual video of the instruments being played in addition to 2D and 3D graphics.

                The app design is prototyped in Figma, a web browser based interface design tool.

        <p>
            The name Medo is derived from medicine; ritual magic by a medicine man, to promote a desired outcome in healing. Pronounced Medow, it resembles an an open field with a peaceful ambiance. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Medo (meadow), is the tactile aspect counterpart of the Sensability app. I utilized a Sindoh 3D WOX 1 3D printer to produce the Medo device.
            The goal of the Medo device is users will be able to feel the vibrations of the sound along with the corresponding music visualizations with haptics integrated in the design. 
            The web development code to function this Medo device is currently in the testing phase. However, the hardware which will function the Medo device will be included in the design. The hardware consists of a Groove for Arduino base shield, rotary angle sensor, sound sensor, red LED sensor and vibration motor.

            Since one of the focuses of this project is a music therapy aspect, the textures on these designs could be similar to occupational therapy objects to relieve stress. The seashell texture on the first idea is inspired by a sensory stimulation guide for individuals with neurocogniitive disorders. The texture on the second idea is inspired by textures which can improve the brain through touch. 
            After this first design, I continued the progress with placing objects with texture qualities to relate with the therapy aspect on the Medo device. 
            With the texture idea relating to the therapy aspect, the overall idea of how the Medo device connects to the app visualizations needed to be improved.

        <p>
            The seashell texture in the original idea was continued into this updated design as the base of the structure would maintain the same shell shape.
            I showed my original designs to Parker, a subject matter expert for my project. I asked Parker, how can I make the design have more intention with the texture? Parker suggested “map unique shapes to the sound I am looking to capture so there is a cohesion between the song, object and vibration movement." 
        </p>
 
        <p>
            For the demo of Medo, it will correspond with the instrumental piano song called “Bird Language” by Chad Crouch on Free Music Archive, an online library of royalty-free music. The corresponding visualization is an example which will be displayed in the final app design. 
        This suggestion led to an initial guide to visualize the piano keys which are played along with the number of times each key was played. If it was a high note, it would be show by a circle, a low note would show a pill shape. 

        Developing the tactile aspect first in Adobe Illustrator, I used the initial music guide for the tactile object and used shapes to represent the piano notation. Once this was complete, I designed the tactile aspect in Cinema 4D.

            I created an example of a paper protype of the tactile aspect which will be 3D printed. Using the paper prototype as a guide, some of the shapes were modeled to achieve an idea of how the actual 3D model will look. After the paper prototype, I continued to develop the shapes to improve the tangible aspect.
            It also served as a guide for the size of the Medo device, since the haptic hardware needed to be included and connected to a computer through a USB connection.

            The Medo design was created in Cinema 4D, a three-dimensional modeling software. The shell design was developed using a spline path, an outlined path which can be extruded,  while sculptural dimension was added by three-dimensional objects.

            Once the Medo design was complete in Cinema 4D, a stereolithography (stl) file was exported into the Sindoh 3DWOX 1 3D printer app to be produced. The Medo device consists of a top and bottom structure. The bottom section holds the hardware and the top section incorporates the tactile representation which connects to the music visualization.
            An extruded addition to the top structure holds the Medo device together.

            The finished Medo device from ideation to production is complete in a 3D printed form. The shapes connecting and representing the visualization is able to be  experienced by touch. The Medo device is ready to be used along with the corresponding music visualization.

        Even though it cannot be heard, users can literally feel the music. The shapes representing the piano notes on the 3D printed Medo device are included on the piano keys in the visualization. In addition, the colors represent the scale in the octave in which the piano key is played. Since the name of the song is “Bird Language”, the music staff has a double meaning displaying the piano keys and illustrating when a bird sings.

        With this formulated idea for Sensability, I am eager to continue pioneering this design concept. Some ideas I have to integrate into Sensability include: adding more genres for the music visualization, possibly having braille music as the texture on the Medo device, and including therapy resources with an automated intelligence aspect. In the future, one of the goals for the Medo device is to be able to 3D print it with a flexible filament.

            One goal for this project is to possibly accompany technology services provided by a music therapist or an organization supporting Deaf and Hard of Hearing audiences.
            If there was an alternative service or accommodation for music, it could possibly benefit Deaf and Hard of Hearing individuals, to enjoy an adaptive music experience.
